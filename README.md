I obtained the main part of the code from this link: [FyrasBJ/Network-Intrusion-Detection-System](https://github.com/FyrasBJ/Network-Intrusion-Detection-System/tree/master). I made some simple modifications to add a user-friendly webpage for viewing logs and starting/stopping the IDS service. 

Requirements:
1. Set up the appropriate environment: python3.6 + scapy + flask.
2. After setting up, run `app.py` and access the website at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

I am not quite sure about the specific GitHub operations yet, but thank you FyrasBJ.
